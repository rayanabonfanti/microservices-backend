# Microservices Project with Spring Boot
This repository contains an example project that demonstrates the implementation of microservices in a Spring Boot application. The project has a main branch called `main` and a secondary branch called `example-microservice`, which is dedicated to developing microservices that communicate with each other using Spring Boot and Java.

## Branch example-microservice
The `example-microservice` branch is the core of this repository and focuses on the development of microservices that collaborate to provide complete application functionality. Each microservice is an independent unit with its own set of responsibilities and capabilities. Communication between these microservices is facilitated by the use of Spring Boot and the Java language.

## How to Use the `example-microservice` Branch

To explore the implementation of microservices with Spring Boot, you can check out the `example-microservice` branch and run the application as follows:

```bash
git checkout example-microservice
```

## Contributions
This project is open to contributions. If you want to add new microservices, improve communication between them, fix bugs, or optimize performance, feel free to open a pull request. Your contribution is valuable and will help expand the functionality and scalability of the project.

We hope this project serves as a solid example of how to develop microservices using Spring Boot and Java, and how they can be used to build efficient and scalable distributed systems.
